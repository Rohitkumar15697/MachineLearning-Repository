1. About GUI_diabetes_predictor-:
	This program is uses logistic regression to calculate the percentage of the diabetic or not diabetic patient. I have taken so much time to
  	complete this because whole project done by myself.
  	I have used tkinter gui library of python for creating a simple GUI and the data which we entered in the entry boxes is stored to the excel file and
	also the outcome (0 or 1)
  	is also stored. i use joblib to dump by logistic model as predictive_model.sav
  	About Files:
  		diabetes.xlsx: This is a file which i downloaded from kaggle.com to make a logistic model according to the historic data
  		Gui_saved_data.xlsx: This is a excel file which is created by me to store new values which we enterd in entry boxes.
  		MyGui.py: This is our main project file where we use all our calculations or prediction model to predict and also the code of GUI.
		Logistic_regression_model.py: This is the model i have created to prdict diabetes and save the model as predictive_model.sav using joblib.
		predictive_model.sav: This is the saved model which is then loaded into the main Gui file. 
  	if U the see the project please give me the feedback. 
  	Thank You
